# Sleep Screen

Meant to be a basic little screen that plays sleep sounds. Made in about a day while I was on vacation.

## Usage

Create two folders: `sounds`, and `images`.

---

In the images folder, put 4 background images: `bg0.jpg`, `bg1.jpg`, `bg2.jpg`, and `bg3.jpg`.

---

In the sounds folder, put 3 sounds: 

`tsra.mp3`: Thunderstorms
`rain.mp3`: Rain
`fan.mp3`: Box fan

---

I don't know the copyright details of the sounds and images that I have, so that's why I didn't upload them with the repository.
